<p>Real world political data, such as election results, location and type of terrorist attacks, or international trade flows, rarely come in nice, clean spreadsheets. Some data files may not even fit in a computerâ€™s main memory. As data analysts, we cannot always rely on other people to get the data into formats that are convenient for us to manage.</p>
<p>This course introduces students to the fundamental computational tools for managing, analyzing, and presenting political data. The material will enable students to become proficient enough to actively implement the methods and tools in their own research.</p>
