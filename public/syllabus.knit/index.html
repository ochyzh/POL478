\section*{Overview and Objectives}
Real data, such as election results, location and type of terrorist attacks, or international trade flows, rarely come in nice, convenient to manage spreadsheets. Most data are not stored in spreadsheets at all. The task of collecting and cleaning the data is frequently upon the data analyst. Time-consuming and challenging as it is, this task need not be tedious and frustrating.</p>
<p>This course introduces students to the fundamental computational tools for cleaning, managing,n storing, analyzing, and presenting political data. The material will enable students to become proficient enough to actively implement the methods and tools in their own research.</p>
<p>\subsection*{Learning Outcomes}
This course is designed as a series of weekly modules that build upon each other. Each module covers one or more state-of-the-art approaches to statistical analysis of network data. For each model covered, the objectives are that students will:</p>
<p>\begin{itemize}
\item Learn how to deal with complex, messy, real data
\item Use graphics to explore, understand, and present data
\item Gain familiarity with basic data collection, storage and management
\item Reshape data into the most convenient form for analysis or reporting
\item Automate cleaning and analysis in R.
\end{itemize}</p>
<p>\section*{Software}
R \url{https://www.r-project.org/}\<br>
RStudio \url{https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/}</p>
<p>\section*{Reading}
The textbook that I recommend for the class is &ldquo;ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis&rdquo; by Hadley Wickham. Note: it&rsquo;s just a recommendation, not a requirement!</p>
<p>\section*{Homework}
Students will have a weekly homework (due before each class). For each homework, students will apply the methods covered that week to a dataset made available by the instructor. Each student will submit their homework as an R-script and a pdf file. Each homework will take 1&ndash;3 hours to complete.</p>
<p>\section*{Coding Sessions}
%For each method covered we will run through applications in R during class. Students are strongly encouraged to bring their laptops to class. Students will be provided with data, but may also use their own datasets.
For each method covered we will run through applications in R during class. Students are strongly encouraged to follow along during class and review/run through these examples after class. Students will be provided with data, but may also use their own datasets.</p>
<p>\section*{Grading Scale}
Grades will be assigned based on performance on the homework assignments. The final grade will be calculated using the following grading scheme to the sum of homework grades.\<br>
\begin{tabular}{ll}
A+ &amp; $\geq 90$   \<br>
A &amp; $\geq 85$  \<br>
A- &amp; $\geq 80$  \<br>
B+ &amp; $\geq 77$   \<br>
B &amp; $\geq 73$   \<br>
B- &amp; $\geq 70$   \<br>
C+ &amp; $\geq 67$   \<br>
C &amp; $\geq 63$   \<br>
C- &amp; $\geq 60$   \<br>
D+ &amp; $\geq 57$   \<br>
D &amp; $\geq 53$   \<br>
D- &amp; $\geq 50$   \<br>
F &amp; $&lt; 50$ \<br>
\end{tabular}</p>
